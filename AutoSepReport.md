## Physio Measures for Sampled Sepsis Patients

- A table listing the patients who currently have sepsis (if any), along
  with their most recent heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate

  - Note: If the below table is empty, this indicates that no patients
    from the most recent, randomly-sampled dataset are currently
    affected by sepsis.

| PatientID |  HR | Temp | Resp |
|:----------|----:|-----:|-----:|

- Plots for all patients who have sepsis (if any) that show the complete
  history of their heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate during
  their time in the ICU.

- A table showing the *change* in heart rate, temperature, and
  respiratory rate between the last two measurements for all patients

| PatientID | Change in Heart Rate | Change in Temperature | Change in Respiratory Rate |
|:----------|---------------------:|----------------------:|---------------------------:|
| 007181    |                    4 |                    NA |                         -2 |
